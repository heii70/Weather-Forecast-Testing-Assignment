<h1>Weather Forecast Testing Demonstration</h1>

This automation testing program demonstrates a simple 10 day weather forecast using Weather Underground API and Selenium Java. The program scripts check and compare several fields like temperature and wind speed obtained from the API and The Weather Channel website. The scripts also obtain from the API the high and low temperatures of the next 10 consecutive days and calculate the difference for each day. The test passes if the difference is less than 20 and fail if otherwise.
