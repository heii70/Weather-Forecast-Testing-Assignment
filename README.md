<h1>Weather-Forecast-using-Selenium</h1>

This automation testing program demonstrates a simple 10 day weather forecast using Weather Underground API and Selenium Java. The program scripts obtain the high and low temperatures of the next 10 consecutive days and calculate the difference for each day. The test scripts pass if the difference is less than 20 and fail if otherwise.
